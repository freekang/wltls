# W-LTLS

Implementation of the learning algorithm proposed in:

Itay Evron, Edward Moroshko, and Koby Crammer. 2018. [**Efficient Loss-Based Decoding On Graphs For Extreme Classification**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03319). NIPS 2018.

Some of our ideas and methods are based on [Log-time and Log-space Extreme Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01964) and its [code](https://github.com/kjasinska/ltls).

## Downloading the data

The multiclass datasets can be downloaded from [PD-Sprase](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~xrhuang/PDSparse/).

## The code will be uploaded soon
